SharedWorker example
====================

This is a tiny example on how to use SharedWorker and communicate through different tabs using this technology.

Despite that the example itself (a chat that works in the same domain, of the same browser, in the same computer), is not really useful, _unless you enjoy talking with your alter ego_, it serves to demonstrate how to communicate and broadcast messages between tabs.

For more documentation about how to use SharedWorker, please visit [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/SharedWorker).
